ΕΡ. ΙΙ. PHYLLIS DEMOPHOONTI. 15

Quae tibi, Demophoon, longis erroribus acto
Threicios portus hospitiumque dedi,

Ouius opes auxere meae, cui dives egenti
Munera multa dedi, multa datura fui:

Quae tibi subieci latissima regna Lycurgi,
Nomine femineo vix satis apta regi,

Qua patet umbrosum Rhodope glacialis ad Haemum,
Et sacer admissas exigit Hebrus aquas:

Oui mea virginitas avibus libata sinistris,
Castaque fallaci nona recincta mana.

Pronuba Tisiphone thalamis ululavit in illis,
Et cecinit maestum devia carmen avis.

Adfuit Alecto brevibus torquata colubris,
Suntque sepulchrali lumina mota sace.
