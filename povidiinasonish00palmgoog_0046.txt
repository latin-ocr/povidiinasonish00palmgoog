PREFAOE. xxxv

was with a feeling of reliefl found that Ι had Madzvg’s
been left a good deal of my own. Madvig has, emendamus.
he sayS, given more pains to the Heroides than

any other of the poems of Ovid. I subjoina

list of his emendations (which had not also

occurred to me), sofar as they were not pre-

viously known from other sources.

ii. 105. Madvig reads ‘Atque tibi excidimus
nullam puto Phyllida nosti.' This is, os course,
possible; but an emendation is not, I think,
absolutely necessary here.

iii. 19. This verse Madvig would punctuate
thus:- ,

Si progressa forem, caperer ne, nocte, timebam ;
· joining ‘ nocte’ with ‘ progressa forem :' wrongly
in my opinion.

iii. 136. For ‘tuis' Madvig reads patris In
this he is probably right, although the occur·
rence os ‘ pater' in the previous line does not
at first sight seem to favour the change.

⁶ iv. 137. Ι am glad to find Madvig finds a
difficulty in this passage, although his reading
does not appear to me to clear up anything:
he reads :-

Nec labor est celare: licet: pete munus ab ipsa (Venere).

The latter part of my English note on this
should be cancelled, as the alteration there
proposed is much too extravagant. 1 would
mark the couplet as spurious. The words ‘pete
munus ab illa’ seem to be imported srom Art.
ii. 575, where they have a meaning. They

have none here. f
