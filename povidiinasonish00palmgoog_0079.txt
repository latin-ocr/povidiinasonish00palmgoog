EPISTOLA IV.

PHAHDRA HIPPOLYTO.

Qus, nisi tu dederis, caritura est ipsa salute,
Mittit Amazonio Cressa puella viro.
Perlege quodcumque est: quid epistola lecta nocebit ?
Te quoque in hac aliquid quod iuvet, esse potest.
His aroana notis terra pelagoque feruntur.
Inspicit acceptas hostis ab hoste notas.
Ter tecum conata loqui ter inutilis haesit
Lingua, ter in primo destitit ore sonus.

Qua licet et sequitur, pudor est miscendus amori.

IV.-The chief source from whence
Orid derived the materiale for this Epistle
was the Hippolytus 01 Euripides, the
spirit 01 which he has wonderfull
caught: in fact the way in which Ovi ,
without being a plagiarrst, seizes on and
enlarges the exact conceptione 01 the
authors from whom hc takes his charac-
ters forms one 01 me most striking attri-
butes 01 his genius. This is well exem·
plified in his Dido, drawn from Virgil's.
This Epistle is supposed to be written to
Hippolytus at Troezen by his step-
mother Phaedra, durin the absence of
lTheseus. Vide Clusall

tus.

yl. Ralla] Though ‘puella’ is gene-
rally used 01 unmarried girls, and some-
times as equivalent to‘virgo' (‘prosit
mihi vos dixisse puellas,’ Juv. iv. 36),
instances are not wanting where it rs

used 01 young married women, as here·
Prop. IV. xii. 17, ‘quid faciet nullo
munita puella timore' 01 Galla, thewife 01
Postumus. lav. iii72,‘Subscribam salvo
grata puella viro! Amazonio:¹ Hippolytus
was son 01 the Amazon Hippolyte, or
Antiope, according to another account.

4. ‘Notas’ and ‘notis’ coming so close
together displease some. But Ovid often
purposely repeats the same phrase for
the sake 01 emphasis. He never does so
accidentally, however, aud therefore this
passage cannot be cited in dcfsnce 01 the
repetition 01 fdolo· in i. 40, 42,whersthere
10Ι no62emphasis whatever. See note on
xry. .

9. Qua lieet-amori] ‘Shame should
be joined to love as far as possible,
and wherever it will accompany it'
The verb ‘sequitur’ is, in my opinion,
best tekenpersonally‚inwhichcase supply
