Madnr'gs s

emendations.

PREFACE.

vi. 100. For ‘se favet’ Madvig reads Sese
avet: suggested to me some tirne ago by Mr. S.
Allan, for want of a better. This is a most
un-Ovidian expression, and l believe my own
emendation is right.

vi. 140. Admirers of Madvig will be truly
sorry to see him assenting to a modification of
the reading of G, which involves a false quan·

‚tity. He proposes t·-

Quodlibet adfizcinus iste dat arma dolor.

Ovid would on no account allow the last syl·
lable of the first penthemimer to be short;
and the only line of this sort now left standing
by Mr. Paley in Propertius, 11. viii. 8:-

Vinceris aut vincis: haec in amore rota est,

should be corrected-

Vinceris aut vincis: sicin amore rota est.

vi.'156. The reading of the best MSS. is, Ι
think, here defended with justice by Madvig. ’
A totidem natis orba sit illa viro:
ie. ‘aster having so many children, may she
be bereft of her husband’ For ‘a’ or ‘ab' =
‘after‚' Madvig quotes Livy, xxrv. xxii. 63
xxxr. viii. 1, ‘ab hac contione‚' ‘ab hac ora-
tione;’ and in Ovid, Art. iii. 2263 Met. xii.
5783 Pont. rv. xv. 4; and other passages,

The passage from the Metamorphoses best de-
fends the idiom :-

A sermone senis repetito munere Bacchi.
