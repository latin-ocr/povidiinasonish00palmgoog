HEROIDES.

Exerces pretiosa odia et constantia magne,
Si, dum macereas, est tibi vile mori.

Iam venti ponent, strataque aequaliter unda
Caeruleis Triton per mare curret equis. ·

Tu quoque eum ventis utinam mutabilis esses ε
Et nisi duritie robora vineis, eris.

Quid, si nescires, insana quid aequore possunt?
Expertae totiens quam mele credis aquae!

Ut elego suadente etiam retinacula solves,

ulte tamen letus tristia pontus habet.
