PREFAOE.

. MSS· consideration of the question, that G is deserv·

ing of any extraordinary pre-eminence among
the more recent MSS. l believe, contrary to
the opinion of Merkel, that G was copied from
P, either directly or indirectly; for there is
'hardly a single passage where a reading of
any importance, hopelessly lost in P, is re-
gained in G. On the other hand, the corrup-
tions in P are the very places where G either
goes wrong, or supplies an obvious correction.
For instance, let the reader examine vi. 140, vii.

. 71, 152, ii. 100, and he can hardly avoid coming

to any other conclusion. Here and there G
and his younger brethren are unfortunately

not only useful, but absolutely necessary, as
there are two or three gaps in P. These are

all, Ep. i. to vs. 14 of Ep. ii.:from iv. 48 to iv.
103: from v. 97 to vi. 49. ·

Faults in p, ln awarding such high praise to this manu·

script, I do not mean to be understood to say
that it is free from faultS, but that itis compara-
tively free from the greatest of faults-namely,
alteration. lt frequently goes wrong in unim-
portant points, where the scribe, who was evi-
dently a very unlearned man, trusted himself
to make a small correction. But this does not
occur in important passages or where the
reading is one of difficulty. There the eorrup-
tions of the archetype are handed down tous
unchanged, while, where the copyist has gone
wrong himself, it is by making mistakes easily
corrected.
