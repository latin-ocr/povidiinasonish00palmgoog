Nos humiles famulaeque tuae data pensa trahemus,
Et minuent plenas stamina nostra colos.
Exagitet ne me tantum tua, deprecor, uxor,
Quae mihi neseio quo non erit aequa modo,
Neve meos coram scindi patiare capillos,

Ι Et leviter dicas ‘haec quoque nostra fuit'
Vel patiare licet, dum ne contempta relinquar:

Hic mihi vae miserae concutit ossa metus.

Quid tamen expectas? Agamemnona paenitet irae,
Et iacet ante tuos Graecia maesta pedes.

Vince animos iramque tuam, qui cetera vincis.-
Quid lacerat Danaae impiger Hector opes?

Arma cape, Aeacide, sed me tamen ante recepta,
Et preme turbatos Marte favente viros.

Propter me mota est, propter me desinat ira:
Ἴ Simque ago tristitiae causa modusque tuae.

Neo tibi turpe puta precibus succumbere nostris.
