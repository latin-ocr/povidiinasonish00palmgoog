HEROIDES.

Quam male inaequales veniunt ad aratra iuvenci,
Tam premitur magno coniuge nupta minor.

Non honor est, sed onus species laesura ferentes.
Siqua voles apte nubere, nube pari.

Vir mihi semper abest, et coniuge notior hospes,
Monstraque terribiles persequiturque feras.

Torqueor, infesto ne vir ab hoste cadat.

Inter serpentes aprosque avidosque leones
Iactor, et haesuros terna per ora canes.
