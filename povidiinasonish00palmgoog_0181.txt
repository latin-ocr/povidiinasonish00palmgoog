128 Eunomus.

Et socer armatas accipit ipse nurus.
Undique conlucent praecinctae lampades auro :
Dantur in invitos impia tura focos : ,
¹Vulgus ‘Hymen Hymenaee' vocant: fugit ille vocantes:
Ipsa Iovis coniux cessit ab urbe sua.
Ecce mero dubii, comitum clamore hequentas,
Flore novo madidas impediente eomas,

In thalamos laeti, thalamos, sua busta, feruntur,
Strataque corporibus, funere digna, premunt.
lamque cibo vinoque graves somnoque iacebant,

Securumque quies alta per Argos erat:

Oirc me gemitus morientum audire videbar:
filamen audieram, quodque verebar, erat.
