The majority of these readings approach
more closely than those hitherto adopted to

rules: while in those instances where an arbi·
trary change has seemed necessary, that change

saw Madvig's defence of the MS. reading,
which is, however, substantially the same as
regards meaning.1

These are all the points of disserence from
Merkel’s text due to modern scholars. Those

derived from Heinsius, and the ancient com- ν

mentators, are pointed out in the notes.
