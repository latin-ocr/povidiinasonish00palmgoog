ΕΡ V. OENONE PARIDI.

Votis ergo meis alii rediture redisti?
Ei mihi, pro dira pellice blanda’fuil
Aspicit immensum moles nativa profimdum:
Mons fuit: aequoreis illa resistit aquis:
Hinc ego vela tuae cognovi prima carinae,
Et mihi per fluctus impetus ire tuit.
Dum moror, in summa fulsit mihi purpura prora. es
Pertimui: cultus non erat ille tuus.
Fit propior, terrasque cita ratis attigit aura:
ι Femineas vidi corde tremente ganas.
Non satis id fuerat-quid enim furiosa morabar ? -
Haerebat gremio turpis amica tue.
Tunc vero rupique sinus et pectora planxi,
Et secui madidas ungue rigente genas,
Implevique sacram querulis ululatibus Iden.
Illuc has lacrimas in mea saxa tuli.
