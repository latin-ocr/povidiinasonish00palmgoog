132 HEROIDES.

Quo bos ex homine est, ex bovo faeta dea.
At satis est poenae teneram mugisse puellam,
Neo, modo formosam, posse plaeere Iovi.

Adstitit in ripa liquidi nova vaooa parentis,
Cornuaque in patriis non sua vidit aquis:
Conatoque queri mugitus edidit ore,
Territaque est forma, territa vooe sua.
Quid furis, infelix? quid te miraris in unda?
Quid numeras fastos ad nova membra pedes f
Illa Iovis magui pellex metuenda sorori,
Fronde levas nimiam caespitibusque famem:

Fonte bibis, speetasque tuam stupefaota figuram, ·
Et, te ne feriant quae geris arma, times.

Quaeque modo, ut posses etiam Iove digna videri,
Dives eras, nuda nuda reoumbis humo.

Per mare, per terres oognataque flumina omnis :
Dat mare, dant amnes, dat tibi terra viam.

Quae tibi oausa fugae? Quid, Io, freta longa pererras?
