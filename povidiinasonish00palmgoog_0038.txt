PREFAOE. xxvii

Perhaps the most striking feature in the Awt'danceos
Codex Puteaneus is the omission of one of two autograpny.
similar syllables or words in juxtaposition. This
habit of copyists is well known to criticS, and

so important is a knowledge of it, that it
may be called the chief aid of the emenda·

tor. Any one ignorant of its value who will
turn over the pages of Mr. Munro's Lucretius,

in which the omitted syllables are printed in
italicS, will derive an instructive lesson re-
specting this habit. It arises from the very
nature of copying, andis by no means con·
fined to ancient scribes. Every one who has
corrected proofs for his printer will remember
how often he has had returned to him such slips
as these: vit for viuri, alcides for abelardo, commis-
saque dextrae for commissaque dextera dextras, all
of which actually were sent in to the editor in
the preparation of this edition. The law may
be thus stated: wherever in poetry there is a
deficiency of syllables or words in a line‚tor
where in prose there is a deficiency in sense,
probably the deficiency arises from the omission
of a syllable or word, the sameas, or similar
to, a syllable or word, next to which it origi·
nally stood. This habitin its most elementary
form is seen exemplied in a remarkable manner
in the MS. we are speaking of. wake for in-
stance the following defective lines :-

vr. Hanc 0 demens Colchisque ablate venenis

1v. Praeposuit Theseus nisi manifesta negemus.

xm. Troas invideo quae sic lacrimosa suorum.
