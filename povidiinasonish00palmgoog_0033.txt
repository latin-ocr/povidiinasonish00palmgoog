PREFAOE.

Studyosthe that by a careful⁴ scrutiny of the corruption he

Heroides.

can restore the passage in accordance with his
ideas of what Ovid should have written. lt is
only when he comes to deal with a poet like'

Propertius that he fully realises the loss of
such a faithful friend as the Puteaneus. When

shocked by bad Latin, or unpoetic language,
or amared by extreme obscurity, the critic
has in the latter case no good, though it may
be corrupt MS, whose corruptions he can
decipher for himself, but he must fall back upon
the solutions arrived at by the poor scholars·
who formed the copyists of the fourteenth and
fifteenth centuries. He must either reject them
or adopt them, and if he reject them, his own
emendation must, in order to be accepted, have
on its side an overpowering amount of self·
evidence, inasmuch as it can appeal to no MS.
authority in its favour. For instance, let us
examine a passage which, l believe it will be
admitted, is the most difficult in Propertius,
Itis 111. xxvi. 83 (ed. Paleyl. He is there
addressing Virgil, and after depreciation of his
own light poems in comparison with the higher
efforts of his friend, goes on to say that, after
all, his own poetry will find readers. We

shall, ,Ι think, agree that the passage should
run as follows :—

Tale facis carmen, docta testudine quale
Cynthius impositis temperat articulis.
Non tamen haec ulli venient ingrata legenti

Sive in amore rudis sive peritus erit.
