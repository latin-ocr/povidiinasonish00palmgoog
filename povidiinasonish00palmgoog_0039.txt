xxviii PREFAOE.

Ayoidance os xnr. Cur venit a verbis multa querela tens. =
dittography· xvr1. Et dabo cunetas—tempore victa manus.

From not recognising the common cause ol
the corruptions these passages are very badly
corrected in later MSS. Here are the correc-
tione, which have been allowed to disfigure
the pages of many editions :-

Hanc tamen o demens Colchisque ablate venenis.

Praeposuit Theseus nisi nos' manifesta negemus,

Troadas invideo quae sic lacrimosa suorum.

—

Cur venit a verbis multa querella tuis.

Et dabo coniunctas tempore victa manus,

The student, from the mere enunciation of the ,
above law, will supply the deficiencies better
himself. There are many other instances in P,
not quite so simple, which will be found ex·
plained in the notes.

I have remarked that this· principle is very
weil known to critics; but it does not seem
to me to have been so thoroughly applied as
it might be. Its application is quite as effec-
tive in Greek as in Latin. By its use my
friend Mr. Tyrrell has made, in my opinion, a
certain and brilliant restoration in the Bacchae
oi Euripides. The MS. gives 2-

i'd', ὢβᾶκχε θηραγρέταν βακχᾶν.
Mr. Tyrrell, by the insertion of a second
θηρ, at once restores metre and poetry.

ἴθ’, ὦ βᾶκχε θὴρ, θηραγρέταν βακχᾶν.
