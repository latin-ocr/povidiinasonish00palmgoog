HEROIDES.

EPISTOLA XIV.
HY-PERMNESTRA LYNOEO.

Mrrrm Hypermnestra de tot modo fratribus uni:
Oetera nuptarum crimine ⁸turba iacet.

Clausa domo teneor gravibusque coercita vinclis τ’
Est mihi supplicii causa fuisse piam.

Quod manus extimuit iugulo demittere ferrum,
Sum rea: laudarer, si scelus ausa forem.

Esse ream praestet, quam sio placuisse parenti.
Non piget inmunes caedis habere manus.
