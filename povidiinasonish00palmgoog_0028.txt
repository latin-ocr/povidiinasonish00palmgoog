lengthens a final short syllable in the middle
of the line in two cases: (1) where either of
the conjunctions el or aut follows a caesura in

word follows. Now, both these rules would
demand a very large induction to establish
that there cannot be any exception to them,
and the instances quoted by Lachmann, chiefly
fromthe Metamorphoses certainly do not suf-

canons. We may well acquiesce in the conclu-

sion of Merkel, that Ovid‚ in these instances,
allowed himself the license, if lieense it is to

be called, common enough among other poets 3
but that when writing his epic poem, the Meta·
