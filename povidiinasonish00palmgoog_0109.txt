HEROIDES.

N ec male parta diu teneat, peiusque relinquat:
Exulet, et toto quaerat in orbe fugam.

Quam fratri germana fuit miseroque parent‘
Filia, tam natis, tam sit acerba viro.

Oum mare, cum terras consumpserit, aera temptet:
Erret inops, exspes, caede cruenta sua.

Haec ego, coniugio fraudata Thoantias oro.
Vivite devoto nuptaque virque toro!
