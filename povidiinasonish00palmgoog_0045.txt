Madvr'g's
emendations

PREFAOE.

important ,emendation on vii. 71, l looked for-
ward with much interest to the appearance
of his second volume, the Adversaria Latina,
which have lately been given to the world. I find
that he has hit upon the same conjecture as Ι
had on two passages -namely, on xii. 17, and
xiii. 122.1 My sheetS, however had been printed
some months before the appearance of the Ad·
versaria Latina, so it was too late to mention
this fact in the notes as Ι had done on vii. 71.
It is, doubtless, highly satisfactory to find ¹one’s
judgment confirmed by such an authority. Ι

look upon Madvig as by far the greatest critic

of the present generation, differing not only
in degree of excellence, but in kind, from the
numerous emendators of the Herwerden and
Lucian Mtiller type. Madvig's emendations

are, for the most part, so pointed, so tho·
roughly do they address themselves to the real

weakness of the text, so replete are they with
common sense, and withal so felicitous, that
the short perusall have been able to give to
his second volume has been one of the richest
intellectual treats l have enjoyed for a very

ἡ long time. But though confirmation by such

an authority is to be coveted, yet there is pro-

· bably more disappointment than pleasure in

being anticipated in a certain emendation, no
matter by whom: and therefore I confess it

¹ In this restorationlfind‚ that we have both been an·
from the Delphin edition, ticipated by one Francius.
