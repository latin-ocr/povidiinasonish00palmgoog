xxxviii

PREFAOE.

Madmgr's if it may not, then a better reading than*
emendations. Madvlg’s is-

Non ego sum tanti-quid non mentz'n's, inique?

If Ι were re-writing my note, Ithink Ι should
give this the preference. ‘inique’ in this case
would be the vocative. ‘Mentiris' occurs
again in the epistle, vs. 81. Another obvious
suggestion, not devoid of merit, is :-

Quid non mereant inique?
vii. 85. Madvig suggests :-
Haec mihi narraras: di me monuere: merentem Ure, cet.
This is quite devoid of value, in my opinion.
vii. 159. He proposes :-

Sic superent quoscumque tua de gente reportat
Mars ferus, et damni sit modus ille tui.

‘hoe est: sic vivant et salvi maneant, quos ferus
Mars ex excidio Troiano superstites fecit et
reportat, nec plus cladis ac damni patrare. Mars
quos in bello et proeliis non delet, reportat'

This is an excellent conjecture, and l would
adopt it. But, strange to say, Madvig does
not seem to see the point of his own emenda-
tion. It clearly is: ‘let Mars (war) be the
limit to your disasters, not Neptune (the sea)
[with whose storrns Dido had been threatening
Aeneas, vs. 60 seqq.].'

vii. 172, Madvig reads,

Nunc levis evectam eontinet alga ratem.

This emendation appears to nre to rob the
line os its poetry.
