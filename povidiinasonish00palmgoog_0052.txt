PREFAGE. xli

tions of Jahn and Loers, which would other·¹ Edituns.
wise be extremely valuable, are thus rendered

comparatively useless. lt is painful indeed to
read a note of Loers where he gives the prefer·
enee to a false reading, propter auctoritatem
librorum, because, forsooth, there are more
copies in favour· of it than on the opposite
side. For, if ever there was a case where votes
should be weighed, not counted, it isin that
of the election between contending readings.
Jahn and Loers are alike also in superstitious
willingness to accept as genuine whatever it
placed before them with Ovid‘s name on it.
Thus they both accept the spurious verses in
the Epistle of Paris, xvii. 39-142, and of Cy·
dippe, xxi. 13, ad fin, and enter into an elabo-
rate defence even of the Epistle of Sappho,
which Jahn has the hardihood to call omnium ’
praestantissima. “

Ι know of no complete English edition of
the Heroides; but l have occasionally made ’
use of the useful notes in Ramsays selections,
and the Eton edition. To these l should add ,
Ruhnken’s Dictata on the Heroides, an excel-
lent book for illustration and reference, but
deficient in critical faculty, and hasty in inter-
pretation.

Ι have also looked at an edition, with a
metrical German translation by Η. Lindemann,
(Leipsic, 1867), a work of merit not generally
known.
