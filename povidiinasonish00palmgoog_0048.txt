PREFAOE. xxxvii

have adopted in the text, ‘is not to be de· Madvig’s
frauded of his due merit of having first seen emendations,
the meaning of the passage, although he substi-
tuted cum for ‘a,' through forgetfulness of the
Ovidian use of the latter preposition, pointed
out by Madvig.

vii. 33. Here Madvig reads :-

Aut ego, quae coepi-neque enim dedignor-amorem,
Materiam curae praebeat ille meae.

This is the best emendation yet proposed,
and gives the meaning ;ι but Ι do not believe
· in it. Ι do not think ‘praebere amorem’ isa
likely expression: praebere is too material.
vii. 45. Madvig reads :—

Non ego sum-tanti-quid nos metr'ris inique? .

But metior is never used by Ovid‚ except of
spacial mensuration. And Madvig's reading
is objectionable on account of nos, which he
is obliged to understand to mean Dido and
Aeneas (‘ lnique et se et Aeneam aestimari di·
cit’). But there is nothing in the passage which
allows us to suppose that Aeneas is blamed
for forming a false estimate of himself. Madvig

does not attempt to take nos=me, Ι suppose
on account of the awkward change from ego.

l prefer my own reading if censeris may stand
for aestimas, which Ι still believe it may ; but

¹The sentiment of these Since others it hath ceased to

lines is well expressed in move.
Bymn’s lines :- ι Yet though I cannot be beloved,

Stil] let me love !’
‘'l'is time this heart should be .
unmoved,
