v. 8, 2.] Such are the arguments, which ap·

pear to me decisive, against the authenticity

of the last seven epistles: if cause has been

have been enumerated in the above list. The
genuine epistle of Sappho having perished,
there remain four which have been subjected to
scepticism. These are the letters of Briseis, Her·
mione, Deianira, and Medea. Tlie authenticity
