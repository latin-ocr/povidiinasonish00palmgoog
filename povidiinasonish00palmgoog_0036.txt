The recension ol the text in this edition is
based upon the critical apparatus given by Mer·
’ kel, supplemented only occasionally by readings
ol the later MSS, taken from the editions of
Jahn and Loers. Merkel's recension is exclu-
sively based on two MSS. (1) P, which I some·
times call by its old name of Puteaneus. This
is a manuscript of the ninth or tenth century,
and is, Merkel observes, one of the best clas-
sical manuscripts in existence. Itis now in
the National Library at Paris, Cat. No. 8242.
(2) G, called Guelferbytanus Ι. in other editionS,
placed by Merkel about the beginning of the

twellth century. I cannot but think that Merkel
has attached too much weight to this codex,
and Ι am glad to find I am supported in this

estimate by the judgment of Dilthey (Cydippe,

p. 134), ‘ Omnino hunc codicem a Merkelio iusto
pluris esse factum crediderim’). ln fact, the
true division of the MSS. is into two classes.
They are—first, the Puteaneus; second, all ·
other manuscripts. The latter class number,
probably, some hundredS, of dates varying
from the twelfth to the fifteenth century. But

the Puteaneus alone is worth all the rest put
together: it is first, and the rest nowhere. ¹
