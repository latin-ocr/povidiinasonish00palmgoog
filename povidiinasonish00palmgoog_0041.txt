PREFAOE.

nvoidanccososa preceding line to emphasise a climax.
‘'m‘’g'alhy· Thus Hor. Ep. 1. xi. 30 :-

Quod petis hic est:
Est Ulubris, animus si te non deficit aequus.

· Eur. Frag. 652.
Πόλλ’ luibae teitaun καί ἄλογοι βροτούς.

. rui λόγοι is proposed by Dindorf ; but λόγοι
has no business here. Il the form καλόλογος
can exist I would read :—

ι Πόλλ’ ἐλπίδες ψεῦδουσι κολόλογοι βροτούς.

‘Fine talking hopes’ (castles in the air). Ac·
cording to the law, καλόλογοι became καλογοιε
sai ἄλογοι.

Tacitus, Annals, i. 51·

Η ‘incessitque itineri et proelio.' Icannot

but think that this is too pregnant a construc-
tion even for Tacitus. ‘He advanced [pre-
pared alike] for menching and fighting! Orelli
defends it by Ann. xiii. 40 : ‘qui viae pariter ac
pugnae composuerat exercitum! But this is
nothing like so strong an expression. Substi-
tute ‘in' or ‘ad’ with the accusative for the
datives in the latter passage, and there is no-
thing· unusual to strike a reader. Make the
same substitution in the first passage, and the
construction is nearly as harsh as before the
substitution. Icannot help believing, inas-
much as the word pars begins the next sen·
tence, that a contracted form of paratus, resem-
bling pars, has dropped out. · Read: ‘Inces-
sitque itineri et proelio paratus. Pars,' etc.
