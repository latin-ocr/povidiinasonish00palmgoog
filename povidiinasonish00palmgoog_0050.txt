PREFAGE.
ix. 106, he reads (P giving ‘ quem’)
Quum tu non esses, iure vir illa luit.

This may be true; it is probable, however,
that the copyist of Pwrote ‘quem' instead of
‘quod‚' taking it for the relative agreeing with
‘vin'

ix. 141. Madvig reads ‘lentz'fcro Eveno.' G
(according to‘ Iahn, not Merkel) has lcnfero.
Madvig objects to ‘letifero' on the ground that
‘[Eveni] fluminis pestiferam aut omnino insa-
lubrem naturam neque in hac re, neque alio-

quin quisquam commemoravit.’ Of ‘lentifero' Ι

he says: ‘appellatio sumpta a lentium palus·
trium supra aquam natantium (τῶν ἐπὶ τῶν

τελμάτων φακῶν) copia’ Madvig says of this
somewhat audacious conjecture, ‘confirma-
tione 'non eget,' but l hardly think he will
find many to agree with him. The river may
be very well called ‘deadly,’ not as a general
epithet‚ but as fatal in this instance to Nessus,

x. 31. Here Madvig notices the difficulty
which must strike every one, and readS,

Aut vidi aut tantum μία me vidisse putavi.

This deserts P, which gives ‘putarem' and
does not offer a good sense. The passage still

wants emendation. Probably ut should be
substituted for the first aut, as the whole line

ought to form the protasis to the pentameter.
Cf. xiii. 89.
xiii. 110. Madvig readS,

Cur venit ab l verbis multa querela tuis.
