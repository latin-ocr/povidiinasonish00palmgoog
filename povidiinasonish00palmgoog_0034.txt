PREFAOE.

‘Howeven these light poems of mine will not
be ungrateful to any reader, whether he be a

tiro or an adept in love: nor have you, Virgil,

the rude cackle of the goose.’ That this is the

the slightest doubt, confirmed as it is by the
whole tenor of the passage, both prior and sub·
sequent to the portion lhave quoted· But this
restoration has to be made without help from
MSS, for they all read animis for audes, the
result of which hasbeen that no modern has
ever understood the passage, although a few
have honestly persuaded themselves that they
have done so. Now had we a MSS. like the Pu·-
teaneuS, we should probablyhave been assisted
in restoring audis bya corruption avido, but
as it is, the passage has to be restored in the
teeth of the MSS. And this is unfortunately
often the case in emending Propertius.

while to record such apparently unmeaning
